Feel free to contribute and use it for yourself, as long as file format is kept consistent.

## Format for Data Algorithms / Structures
Keep shortened version of data algorithm/structure (DFS.md instead of Depth First Search.md)

## Format for Leetcode Problems
- x: problem number (ex. 1028)
- y: problem name (ex. Binary Search)
<h4>Format: (x)(y).md</h4>

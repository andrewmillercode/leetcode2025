# Abstract Data Type (ADT)
is an abstraction of a data structure which provides only the interface which a data structure must adhere to. It doesn't provide any concrete implementation details.

For Instance, a List(ADT) can be implemented as a dynamic array, or a linked list in practice. 

A Queue(ADT) can be implemented as a linked list or a stack in practice.
